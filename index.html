    <p class="text">Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
                    Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
                    Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
                    Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh<br>

    <p class="text">I messed up tonight<br>
                    I lost another fight<br>
                    I still mess up but I'll just start again<br>
                    I keep falling down<br>
                    I keep on hitting the ground<br>
                    I always get up now to see what's next<br>
                    Birds don't just fly<br>
                    They fall down and get up<br>
                    <span class="text-italic">Nobody learns without getting it wrong</span></p>
    <p class="text">I won't give up, no, I won't give in<br>
                    'Til I reach the end<br>
                    And then I'll start again<br>
                    No, I won't leave<br>
                    I wanna try everything<br>
                    I wanna try even though I could fail<br>
                    I won't give up, no, I won't give in<br>
                    'Til I reach the end<br>
                    And then I'll start again<br>
                    No, I won't leave<br>
                    I wanna try everything<br>
                    I wanna try even though I could fail</p>

                    Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh</p>
    <p class="text">Look how far you've come<br>
                    You filled your heart with love<br>
                    Baby you've done enough, take a deep breath<br>
                    Don't beat yourself up<br>
                    Don't need to run so fast<br>
                    Sometimes we come last but we did our best</p>
    <p class="text">I won't give up, no, I won't give in<br>
